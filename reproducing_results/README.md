Reproducing Results
-------

The directory contains scripts to reproduce the main results of the Nifty software. 
The main result of our evaluation is that Nifty does not impose high overhead. Section 6.1 presents our main results with HDFS and Kafka through comparing the system throughput with and without Nifty.

This directory contains the scripts to reproduce the results presented in section 6.1. The directory has two sub directories, one for HDFS and one for Kafka.
